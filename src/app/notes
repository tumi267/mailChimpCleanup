    App Concept: Mailchimp Audience Cleanup and Tagging Tool

Objective:

Develop an external application that integrates with Mailchimp to automate the cleanup of audiences by removing duplicates and organizing contacts into tags, ensuring streamlined management.

 
Key Features:

1. Data Cleanup:
Duplicate Detection and Merging:

•	Identify duplicate contacts using unique identifiers like email addresses.

•	Merge duplicate records by combining custom fields, tags, and engagement history.

•	Allow user-defined rules for how duplicates should be handled (e.g., keeping the most recent record).

Invalid Email Detection:
•	Automatically flag or remove invalid or bounced email addresses to maintain a clean list.

Unsubscribed/Inactive Contact Removal:
•	Archive or delete contacts that are unsubscribed or have been inactive for a defined period.


2. New List Creation for Deduplicated Data:
Safe Data Migration:

•	Create a new Mailchimp list containing only deduplicated contacts, leaving the original list untouched as a backup.

•	Ensure all relevant information, such as tags, custom fields, and engagement metrics, is accurately copied over to the new list.



Conflict Resolution:

•	Provide options to resolve conflicts during the merging process, such as differing custom field values between duplicates.

3. Segmentation:

Predefined and Custom Segments:

•	Create and maintain predefined segments based on tags for streamlined audience management.

•	Allow users to build custom segments using a combination of tags, behaviors, and custom criteria.

4. Integration and Deployment:

Mailchimp API Integration:

•	Seamlessly connect with Mailchimp via its API to manage audiences, tags, and segments.

•	Handle operations like list creation and contact migration in batches to avoid API rate limits.

User-Friendly Interface:

•	Design an intuitive UI with a dashboard for monitoring audience health, cleanup progress, and tagging status.

•	Include a guided setup for connecting to Mailchimp, configuring settings, and starting the cleanup process.

Cloud Hosting:

•	Deploy the app on a cloud platform Vercel, for scalability and reliability.

 



User Flow:

Connect to Mailchimp:

•	User securely connects their Mailchimp account to the app via OAuth.

Analyze Audience:

•	The app scans the selected audience, identifying duplicates, invalid emails, and inactive contacts.

Preview and Configure:

•	Users preview the suggested changes, customize merge rules for duplicates, and configure tagging rules.
Create New List:

•	The app generates a new list with deduplicated and cleaned data, leaving the original list intact.

•	A detailed summary report is provided after the process.

Review and Refine:

•	Users can review the new list, make adjustments if necessary, and start using the cleaned-up audience for campaigns.
